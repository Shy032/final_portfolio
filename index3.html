            <p><strong>Background and Client Needs:</strong> As a student at UCSD majoring in Real Estate and Development and an active trader on platforms like Robinhood and Coinbase, I have honed my skills in financial analysis and trading. This case study focuses on two significant trades: predicting Tesla's earnings and capitalizing on the Luna coin's market movements. These experiences highlight my analytical abilities, use of professional tools, and strategic decision-making in trading.</p>

            <h3>Predicting Tesla's Earnings</h3>
            <p><strong>Market Research and Analysis:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Earnings Reports and Financial Metrics:</strong> I meticulously analyzed Tesla's previous earnings reports, noting the company's revenue growth, vehicle production numbers, and key financial metrics such as Earnings Per Share (EPS). For Q1 2022, analysts had predicted an EPS of $2.31 and revenue of $17.9 billion.</li>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain and Production Challenges:</strong> I considered the global supply chain issues and their impact on Tesla's production capabilities. This included understanding the semiconductor shortages and production delays in Tesla's Shanghai factory due to COVID-19 lockdowns.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyst Predictions and Market Sentiment:</strong> Reviewing analyst predictions and market sentiment, I found that analysts expected Tesla to report an EPS of $3.22 and revenue of $18.8 billion for Q1 2022. This prediction was based on increased vehicle deliveries, higher average selling prices, and Tesla's ability to scale production despite challenges.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Trading Strategy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Options Trading:</strong> Based on my analysis, I anticipated a positive earnings surprise. I purchased call options on Tesla stock, which would increase in value if the stock price rose post-earnings.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> To mitigate risks, I set stop-loss orders and monitored the stock's price movements closely, ready to adjust my position as needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Tesla's strong earnings report led to a significant increase in its stock price. My call options rose in value, resulting in substantial profits. This successful prediction and trade demonstrated my ability to analyze financial data, predict market movements, and execute strategic trades effectively.</p>

            <h3>Profiting from Luna Coin's Market Movements</h3>
            <p><strong>Market Research and Analysis:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Market Trends and Sentiment:</strong> I closely followed the market trends and sentiment around Luna coin, noting significant price fluctuations and market news.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> I utilized technical analysis tools, such as moving averages and Relative Strength Index (RSI), to identify potential entry and exit points. I also monitored trading volumes and price patterns to make informed decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Fundamental Analysis:</strong> Understanding the underlying technology and the team behind Luna coin, as well as broader market factors affecting the cryptocurrency space, was crucial in forming my trading strategy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Trading Strategy:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Buying at the Bottom:</strong> During a significant market dip, I recognized an opportunity to buy Luna coin at a low price, anticipating a rebound based on historical price patterns and market recovery trends.</li>
                <li><strong>Selling on the Rise:</strong> As the price of Luna coin increased, I strategically sold my holdings to maximize profits. This involved setting target prices and monitoring the market continuously to execute trades at the optimal times.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> By buying Luna coin at its bottom and selling as the price rose, I achieved a substantial return on investment. This trade underscored my ability to apply both technical and fundamental analysis in the cryptocurrency market, navigate market volatility, and make profitable trading decisions.</p>

            <h4>Tesla Earnings Prediction:</h4>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Financial Modelling:</strong> Using tools like Excel and financial modelling software, I created projections for Tesla's earnings based on production numbers, revenue estimates, and cost analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Options Strategy:</strong> I employed a bull call spread strategy, purchasing call options at a lower strike price and selling call options at a higher strike price to limit potential losses while maximizing gains.</li>
                <li><strong>Earnings Call Analysis:</strong> I tuned into Tesla's earnings call, paying attention to key comments from the CEO and CFO about future projections and strategic initiatives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Luna Coin Trading:</h4>

                <li><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> Applying Fibonacci retracement levels, Bollinger Bands, and MACD indicators, I identified key support and resistance levels for Luna coin.</li>
                <li><strong>Entry and Exit Points:</strong> Based on the analysis, I set buy orders at identified support levels and sell orders at resistance levels to capture profit during price rallies.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> To protect against sudden market downturns, I set stop-loss orders and continuously monitored market news for any developments that could impact the cryptocurrency market.</li>
            </ul>
